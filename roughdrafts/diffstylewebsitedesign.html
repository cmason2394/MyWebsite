	        <h2>About</h2>
	        <article>Hi there! This is my test-trial into the world of coding. I am interested in programming and data analysis, and this web page is a way to learn and practice coding, while keeping track of where I am and where I want to go. I am exploring building websites, designing apps, and analyzing data. </article>

	      <h2> Projects</h2>
	      <ul>
          <li><h3>Website design</h3>
        Learn how to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. Potentially design websites professionally.</li>
          <li><h3>App development</h3>
      Learn how to create apps! Design a riddle app, where you could find riddles, get hints when you are stuck, and upload your own riddles.</li>
		    <li><h3>EveryDollar visual representations</h3>
      I use a personal finance app called EveryDollar. It is great, except it doesn't have visual representations of how I allocate and spend my money. I want to learn how to grab the numerical data from the app and show it in graphs and charts to better understand my finances over time.

      </li>
        <li><h3>Energy Use visual representations</h3>
      My mom relies entirely on solar and battery storage for energy use at her house. She wants a visual representation of real-time energy use without going through the internet so that other people can't access her data.</li>
